## Overview

### Summary

This repository serves as the central hub for the libp2p project, a modular networking framework and protocol suite for building peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. It provides high-level information, links to various language implementations, community resources, and project-wide standards.

### Purpose

The project aims to simplify the development of large-scale P2P systems by providing a modular, interoperable, and upgradeable network stack. It abstracts the complexities of P2P networking, allowing developers to use only the protocols they need.

### Key Features

• Modular networking framework for P2P systems
• A full stack of composable P2P protocols
• Multiple language implementations (Go, JavaScript, Rust, Python, etc.)
• Clean separation of concerns in the network stack
• Strong focus on interoperability and upgradeability

## Technical Stack

### Languages

Markdown, YAML, JSON

### Key Dependencies

ipdxco/unified-github-workflows (for GitHub Actions)

### Tools

GitHub Actions

## Project Structure

### Architecture

This is a meta-repository that acts as a central information hub for the libp2p ecosystem. It does not contain a runnable software application but rather documentation, community links, and project-wide configuration and process guides. The architecture of the libp2p project itself, which this repository describes, is a modular protocol stack.

### Main Components

**README.md** `README.md`

The main landing page for the libp2p project, providing an overview, links to specifications, implementations, and community channels.

**ISSUE-LABELLING.md** `ISSUE-LABELLING.md`

A comprehensive guide defining the taxonomy for labeling GitHub issues across libp2p repositories. This document standardizes the process for triaging, tracking, and managing development tasks.

**GitHub Workflows** `.github/workflows/`

Automated workflows for repository maintenance, specifically for closing stale issues and generated pull requests.

**Funding Configuration** `FUNDING.json, funding.json`

JSON files specifying project identifiers for receiving funding from platforms like Drips (Filecoin) and Optimism RetroPGF.

### Directory Structure

The repository has a flat structure, with key documentation and configuration files at the root. A `.github` directory contains CI/CD workflows for repository management. The `README.md` also references a `logo` directory which contains project branding assets.

## Setup Instructions

### Running Locally

This repository is not a runnable software project. It contains documentation and configuration files for the broader libp2p ecosystem. To work with libp2p, you would choose one of its language implementations listed in the README.

## Configuration

### Configuration Files

• **FUNDING.json** - Configures funding through the Drips platform, linking the project to a Filecoin wallet address.
• **funding.json** - Configures funding through Optimism's Retroactive Public Goods Funding (opRetro) by providing a project ID.
• **.github/workflows/stale.yml** - GitHub Actions workflow configuration to automatically identify and close stale issues.
• **.github/workflows/generated-pr.yml** - GitHub Actions workflow configuration to automatically close pull requests that are identified as being generated.

## Development

### Code Style

Not applicable as there is no application code. Markdown files are well-structured and used for documentation.

### Testing

No testing infrastructure is present as this is not a code repository.

### Contributing

Contributions are highly structured. The `ISSUE-LABELLING.md` file details a sophisticated taxonomy for classifying issues by area, component, kind, difficulty, effort, priority, and status. This system is designed to streamline development planning and make it easier for new contributors to find suitable tasks. The `README.md` also directs contributors to numerous community forums and chat channels for discussion and support.

## Additional Notes

This repository is the organizational and informational core of the libp2p project. It aggregates links to all official implementations, specifications, and community platforms. The presence of detailed contribution guidelines and funding configuration files indicates a mature, well-organized, and actively maintained open-source project.
